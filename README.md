# java-opencv3-swing

This is the example Gradle project how to access camera with OpenCV 3 and Java.

**NOTE: This is not for Android directly**

Thumbs up for Huiying S.

This project is based on Huiying's blog post http://computervisionandjava.blogspot.fi/2013/10/java-opencv-webcam.html

I've fixed the the Mat to BufferedImage part where the output image was blueish.

## Run the example

1. Modify the OpenCV path in needed to `build.gradle`
2. Call `./gradlew run`
